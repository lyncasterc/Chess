# chess
### A simple command line chess game written in Ruby.

This was completed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. 
It's a simple CLI chessgame written in Ruby. The project is meant to test our skills with Ruby, OOP and handling a project of this size.

If you'd like to try it out, clone this repo onto your machine and `cd` into it.
Then simply run: 

`ruby lib/chessgame_main.rb`

There is no option to play against a human player. You'll be playing against a simple computer that I wrote.

**Note:** You may have to upgrade to the latest version of Ruby. There are some built-in Ruby methods being used which are only available in the newer versions.
